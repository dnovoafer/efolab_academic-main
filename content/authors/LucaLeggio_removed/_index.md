I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) and visitor at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) since June 2023. Experienced in ultrafast nonlinear phenomena in multimode fibers and ultrafast ablation of metals. I am currently working on the confinement of quantum light in anti-resonant fibers. I am passionate about world exploration, cinema and sports, and I am also addicted to playing sports like running, cycling and martial arts.

Long-time parrot lover and accompanied for years by a cute pair of agapornis.
