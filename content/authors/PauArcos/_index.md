I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) in Spain. My area of research consists in compact UV sources with hollow-core fibres, which clearly says that I really like light-matter interaction and playing with lasers (in a good sense). Other interests that qualify me, must be the passion for nature and reading.
