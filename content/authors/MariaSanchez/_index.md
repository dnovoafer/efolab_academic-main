I am a Physics PhD Student at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). My research interests include Nonlinear Optics and Quantum Photonics, fields I am currently working in, with anti-resonant hollow-core fibres. I am also curious about Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality. Devotion for science and technology, but also for poetry, novels, crochet and sports. Passion for travelling and languages. Always open to know more, to learn, and to experience new adventures.
