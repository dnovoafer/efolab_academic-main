Part of the team participated in [Zientzia Astea (Week of Science) 2025](https://zientzia-astea.eus/es/)! They organized a stand as part of our Student Chapter **Fotonekin**, featuring different experiences related to the properties of light (aparently hidden to the eye). Among other experiments, adapted to a broad audience spanning high-school students and general public, they showed how polarized glasses work, what fluorescence is and how to use it for sensing, or why quantum cryptography enhances security. It was a big success and lots of fun! Looking forward to the next outreach activity 😊
