Maria, Pau and Arturo attended the [VII International School on Light Sciences and Technologies (ISLIST)](https://www.teisa.unican.es/ISLiST/), where they could learn about the latest breakthroughs in Communications, Sensing and Lighting from several eminent experts in those fields. It was a great experience that provided the unique possibility to reach out and interact with the speakers, as well as with the other students. Keep an eye on this event! A summer highlight for the national photonics community.
