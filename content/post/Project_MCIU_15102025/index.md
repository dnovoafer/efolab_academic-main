The second quantum revolution demands advancements in quantum frequency conversion and customizable quantum light sources, key enablers for the future hybrid quantum networks. The vision and main goal of our new project ARQITECH is addressing these challenges using hollow-core anti-resonant fibres. The project also includes a fully-funded 4-year PhD position. Exciting times ahead!
