I had the privilege to participate in the 2024 edition of the international outreach event ["Pint of Science"](https://pintofscience.es), aimed at bringing cutting-edge research to the relaxed atmosphere of a bar. It was a fantastic experience that will surely not be my last! Thanks to the organizers and the curious and respectful crowd that turn up at [Hika Ateneo](https://hikaateneo.eus) in Bilbao.
